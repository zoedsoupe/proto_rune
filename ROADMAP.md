# ProtoRune Roadmap

**Mission**: Build a production-ready, type-safe AT Protocol SDK and bot framework for Elixir that leverages BEAM's strengths for reliability and concurrency.

**Current Status**: v0.2.0 MVP âœ… Complete | Next: v0.3.0 in development

---

## Core Principles

1. **ATProto Alignment**: Reflect AT Protocol's layered architecture (Identity â†’ Repository â†’ Lexicon â†’ Application)
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple tasks are simple, complex tasks are possible
3. **Explicit Over Implicit**: Functional style with explicit session passing, no hidden global state
4. **OTP Native**: Leverage GenServers, Supervisors, and Telemetry for reliability
5. **Type Safety**: Runtime validation with Peri schemas

---

## v0.2.0 MVP âœ… Complete

**Status**: Released - Production ready for basic use cases

### What's Included

#### Core Protocol Layer
- âœ… XRPC client with explicit session management
- âœ… Identity resolution (DID/handle) with caching
- âœ… Repository operations (create, get, put, delete, list records)
- âœ… Session management with automatic token refresh
- âœ… Structured error handling with proper error tuples

#### Bluesky High-Level API
- âœ… Post creation with text and rich text
- âœ… Social interactions: like, unlike, repost, unrepost
- âœ… Graph operations: follow, unfollow, block, unblock, mute, unmute
- âœ… Timeline and thread retrieval
- âœ… Profile operations: get profile, get multiple profiles
- âœ… Notifications: list, get unread count, mark as seen
- âœ… RichText builder with automatic facet generation for mentions, links, hashtags

#### Bot Framework
- âœ… OTP-based bot behavior with GenServer
- âœ… Polling strategy for notifications
- âœ… Event handlers for: mention, reply, like, repost, follow, quote
- âœ… Automatic login and session management
- âœ… Supervision tree support for reliability

#### Developer Experience
- âœ… Comprehensive guides (getting started, authentication, posting, bots, repository operations)
- âœ… User-friendly README with clear examples
- âœ… 130+ passing tests
- âœ… Proper documentation structure in ExDoc

#### Infrastructure
- âœ… Lexicon generator and type mapper (code exists)
- âœ… Mix task for lexicon generation
- âœ… Git submodule with official AT Protocol lexicons

### Known Limitations (v0.2.0)

- Reply threading uses stub values (issue #22)
- No lexicon schemas generated yet (pending: run mix task)
- Basic error handling (needs edge case coverage - issue #21)
